* [spring5-embedmongo](https://github.com/jonathanlermitage/manon/tree/spring5-embedmongo): use **embedded MongoDB** during tests.
* [spring5-mvn-to-gradle](https://github.com/jonathanlermitage/manon/tree/spring5-mvn-to-gradle): migration from **Maven to Gradle**. Stable and functional, but still needs some improvements.
